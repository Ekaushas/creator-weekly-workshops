# Build a Simple Chat App

NOTE: This tutorial follows after our [Ionic Auth](../04-ionic-auth-and-gravatar) for the user authentication, but you can use whatever name/email service you'd like.

Add Firebase to your app to get a realtime chat up and running quickly. Follow along with the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbQf8cNePMM) and use the code here to add it to your app!
